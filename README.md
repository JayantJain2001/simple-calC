# Simple Calculator (Task-1)  
<p>This Java program implements a simple calculator that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Upon execution, the program presents the user with a menu where they can select the desired operation. It then prompts the user to input two numbers and performs the chosen operation on them. Division by zero is handled gracefully with an appropriate error message displayed to the user. The program continues to run until the user chooses to exit. It provides a straightforward and user-friendly interface for performing multiple calculations within a single session.</p>
